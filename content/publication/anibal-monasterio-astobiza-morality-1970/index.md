abstract: In 1970 Robert J. White (1926-2010) tried to transplant the head of a Rhesus
  monkey into another monkey’s body. He was inspired by the work of a Russian scientist,
  Vladimir Demikhov (1916-1998), who had conducted similar experiments in dogs. Both
  Demikhov and White have been successful pioneers of organ transplantation, but their
  scientific attempts to transplant heads of mammals are often remembered as infamous.
  Both scientists encountered important difficulties in such experiments, including
  their incapacity to link the spinal cord, which ended up by creating quadriplegic
  animals. In 2013, neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero claimed his capacity and plan to
  carry out the first human head transplantation. According to Canavero, spinal linkage
  offers now the possibility of successfully transplanting the head and, by doing
  so, circunventing many of the somatic diseases afflicting human beings. In this
  article, we anticipate and discuss some ethical problems associated with the potential
  practice of human head transplants, and we consider how the possibility of a head
  transplant deals with our long-held metaphysical views on personal identity. Finally,
  we resolve for a moratorium of head transplants due to its lack of biomedical consensus.
