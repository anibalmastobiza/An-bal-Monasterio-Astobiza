abstract: The natural-artificial distinction is not only an abstract metaphysical
  question dedicated to classifying and differentiating between entities and phenomena
  that occur in nature from man-made objects. The distinction between the natural
  and the artificial is central to the philosophy of technology and an interesting
  heuristic to discuss important notions about the growing process of technologization
  in sport. For example, if one accepts the natural-artificial distinction, one is
  against any genetic intervention to improve sports performance because one would
  consider it unnatural. In this article, I present an argument against the natural-artificial
  distinction and defend the ethical permissibility of the technologization of sport.
